## Data interpretation
Once the data has been plotted, it can be observed that there is a negative correlation between Number of Students in Dutch Universities and the total consumption of beer in the Netherlands for 2009- 2012. From 2013 onwards,  there is strong correlation between the two suggesting, a possiblity with more active student life:)
